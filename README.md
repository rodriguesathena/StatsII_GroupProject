This is the repository for a Group Project for Applied Statistics II at TCD. 
This project utilises R and Python to analyse how stop and frisk searches in New York City have changed with the mayoral term of Eric Adams. Data was sourced from the NYPD Stop and Frisk Reports Database, the 2020 United States Census data, and the NYPD Citywide Seven Major Felony Offenses dataset. Due to the size of these datasets they cannot be uploaded to this repository, however, the final cleaned dataset, as well as the processing code, can be found in the data section.

Collaborators: Daniel Heneck, Darragh McGee, Athena Rodrigues, Clare Zureich
